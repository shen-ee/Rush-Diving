What are the challenges we are facing:
* Do not know how to solve the problem of task division, considering that there is only one debugging equipment.

What we are planning to do next:
* Decide how we work collaboratively
* Come up with a detailed development schedule

### Dev Week 2 (10.3-10.9)
What have we achieved:
* We researched possible assets and decided to use the following: [**Horizion[ON]**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/horizon-on-31861),[**TinyDragonMonster**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/tinydragonmonster-143747)
* Created a simple vertical free-falling for testing assets and also as a Unity practice.
* A new demo video:[**Google Drive**](https://drive.google.com/a/usc.edu/file/d/1rl_wLszay-dfrV7YKDHo7zEqufTeJlkf/view?usp=sharing)

What are the challenges we are facing:
* Set up development environment.

What we are planning to do next:
* Create a test landing experience according to our design.

### Dev Week 3 (10.10-10.16)
What have we achieved:

* Settled theme of the game environment and basic gameplay mechanisms. 
* Created a short landing experience for testing.

What are the challenges we are facing:

* Dizziness during fall.

What we are planning to do next:

* Group Discussion for starting page
* Improve the control for turning.
* How to win this game and make the final win result page

### Dev Week 4 (10.17-10.23)
What have we achieved:

* Adjusted body position during falling to reduce dizziness.
* Added control for turning left and right.

What are the challenges we are facing:

* The control for turning is not natural compare to real flying motion.
* The dizziness during falling is still not fully resolved.

What we are planning to do next:

* Improve turning control.
* Add obstacle spawner and collision events.
* Add UI for start/pause/gameover.

### Dev Week 5 (10.24-10.30)
What have we achieved:

Starting scene set up and tested

* Turning control improved. It's now more realistic to real flying experience. (Previously using controller button, now using
controller relative position)
* Added rock spawner and collision events. Currently, the game is over if player collides with one of the rocks. At this point it's for testing purpose and will be subject to change in the future. 
* Fixed a memory usage issue when loading start menu.

What are the challenges we are facing:
* The randomization in rock spawner needs to be improved -- e.g. respawn frequency and rock rotation. Some times the rocks behaves weirdly.
* There's an inconsistency of Unity versions between the PC in SCA lab and our PC at home, which brings difficulty to our developement in the lab.

What we are planning to do next:

* Add more obstacles (e.g. monsters) and related events into the game.
* Add UI for players status.
* Communicate with lab coordinator to solve the version problems.
